# IoT Security: Mitigating Cybersecurity Threats in Connected Devices

This project explores the security challenges of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems and demonstrates practical strategies to mitigate risks. It focuses on device-level, network-level, and data security controls to strengthen resilience against cyber threats.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify common vulnerabilities in IoT devices and networks.  
- Simulate cyberattacks targeting IoT systems.  
- Apply mitigation techniques to reduce risks.  
- Propose best practices for securing IoT environments.  

## 🛡️ Strategies Applied
**Device-Level Security**  
- Strong authentication mechanisms  
- Data encryption and secure firmware updates  
- Physical device hardening  

**Network-Level Security**  
- Network segmentation  
- Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)  
- Secure communication protocols (TLS/SSL, MQTT with authentication)  

**Data Security**  
- Data minimization and tokenization  
- Regular backups  
- IoT security by design principles  
- Legal and regulatory compliance approaches  

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
