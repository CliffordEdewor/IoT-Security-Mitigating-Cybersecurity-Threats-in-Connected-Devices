# IoT Security Mitigating Cybersecurity Threats in Connected Devices

This project explores the security challenges of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems and demonstrates practical strategies to mitigate risks. It focuses on device-level, network-level, and data security controls to strengthen resilience against cyber threats.

## Objectives
- Identify common vulnerabilities in IoT devices and networks.  
- Simulate cyberattacks targeting IoT systems.  
- Apply mitigation techniques to reduce risks.  
- Propose best practices for securing IoT environments.  

## Strategies Applied
**Device-Level Security**  
- Strong authentication mechanisms  
- Data encryption and secure firmware updates  
- Physical device hardening  

**Network-Level Security**  
- Network segmentation  
- Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)  
- Secure communication protocols (TLS/SSL, MQTT with authentication)  

**Data Security**  
- Data minimization and tokenization  
- Regular backups  
- IoT security by design principles  
- Legal and regulatory compliance approaches  

## Tools & Technologies
- Wireshark (traffic analysis)  
- Snort IDS  
- IoT device emulators/testbeds  
- Secure protocols and configurations
